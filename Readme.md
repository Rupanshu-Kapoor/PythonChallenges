Welcome to the PythonChallenges!

This is my practice repository.
Here I am learning Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) in python.


For **Understanding** DSA concepts I am taking help from [DSA Specialization ](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms#courses). Its a 6 course series specialization that offers
1. [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)(Python Programming, Linear Programming, NP-Completeness, Dynamic Programming)
2. [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
3. [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
4. [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
5. [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
6. [Genome Assembly Programming Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)

For **practice**, I am currently using [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)
